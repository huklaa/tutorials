/**
 * Tests for WithdrawConsume — the post-withdraw informational panel that tells
 * the user the Epoch allocator delivered a P2ID note to their Miden wallet
 * (which auto-consumes it). Verifies:
 *
 * 1. Renders nothing when there's no note id (pre-withdraw state).
 * 2. Renders the informational panel when a note id is supplied, with the
 *    note id truncated and a Midenscan link.
 * 3. Renders the same panel even without a wallet account id — the panel is
 *    informational only; there is no in-app consume action that depends on
 *    the wallet account.
