///
/// # Flow
/// 1. Note is created by a depositor specifying the withdrawal details
/// 2. Bank account consumes this note
/// 3. Note script reads the storage items (asset, serial_num, tag, note_type; script_root is read by the bank itself)
/// 4. Calls `account.withdraw(asset, serial_num, tag, note_type)`
/// 5. Bank identifies the depositor internally via `active_note::get_sender()` — cryptographically bound to this note's metadata, so it cannot be spoofed
/// 6. Bank updates the depositor's balance and creates a P2ID note to send assets back
///
/// # Note Storage (14 Felts)
/// [0-3]: withdraw asset, encoded as [amount, 0, faucet_suffix(+metadata), faucet_prefix].
///        Reconstructed into the v0.16 vault key [0, 0, storage[2], storage[3]] and value
///        [amount, 0, 0, 0]. `storage[2]` carries the faucet suffix with the asset's metadata
///        byte in its low 8 bits (host side: `FungibleAsset::to_id_word()[2]`), not the raw
///        suffix — so the bank reconstructs exactly the key the depositor's asset had.
/// [4-7]: serial_num (random/unique per note)
/// [8]: tag (P2ID note tag for routing)
/// [9]: note_type (1 = Public, 0 = Private)
/// [10-13]: P2ID script_root (MAST root of the P2ID note script, Poseidon2-hashed).
///          Consumed by the bank account directly from the active note's storage inside
///          `Bank::withdraw`, so it never appears on the call — this keeps that
///          function within the flat-params limit (≤ 16).
